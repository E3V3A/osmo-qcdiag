Utility to configure Qualcomm DIAG, read, decode and display the
DIAG messages. It can enable logging and format/print the log
messages generated by the various subsystems of the baseband.

To build this software a copy of the Osmocom libosmocore
library is required. Your distribution might already contain
the necessary utility.

In general all Qualcomm devices that export DIAG should be
supported. We have tested it with the Quectel UC20, EC20 and
EC25 devices.
