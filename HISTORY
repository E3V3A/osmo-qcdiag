The initial version of this utility was created by Dieter Spaar
and ran on Windows. It used the DIAG protocol to read and write
memory.

It was ported to Linux by Holger Freyther and extended to enable
and parse GSM RF measurement results. The measurement results
were used during EMC tests of GSM equipment.

Harald Welte greatly extended and re-wrote the utility to decode
more fields, e.g. the GPRS messages.
