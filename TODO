* import parsing + dispatch of 2G/3G/4G control plane via GSMTAP using
  code or know-how from https://github.com/moiji-mobile/diag-parser
* forward the printed text log messages via GSMTAP-LOG so they can be
  seen in-line with protocol decode in (recent) wireshark
* have a proper send-and-wait-for-reply mecahnsim when sending config
  requests
* use the proper config requests to determine the available SSIDs and
  massk, as well as log-masks.
* add decoders for missing 2G/3G/4G state change related events
* investigate more MSG sub-systems
* add a VTY interface for configuration of sub-systems/log-flags
